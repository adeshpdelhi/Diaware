add active and inactive state of patient and a corresponding hook - patient inactive shift to inactive patients table

one time icu/ipd appointment - ignore these by event scheduler
dont add icu/ipd to shiftpatients - one time event -direct add to list of appointments
add another option - take direct appointment  by date (of the category of icu/ipd (mostly); but keep it generic)
unke bolne pe hatayenge
--useless--list of inactive schedules of a patient


problem- creating and updating of carePlan both provided; on update prev version of careplan would get deleted as of now... so each time major change in careplan - suggested to create a new careplan forthat patient to have prev version stored; otherwise we need to change update backend


add paranoid:true to each model - no record is deleted from the table

-----done(in most of the places)-----remove update promise ... returns array -expects object - change put functions everywhere to return only status code

pre dialysis
-----done-----fetch last post hd weight from db ....
